                        <P>MPs have been warned about using the hugely popular TikTok video app for fear the data
                            could be accessed by the Chinese Government.Late last week, party whips were issued with
                            a reminder from Speaker Trevor Mallard that MPs should not use the app on Parliamentary
                            Service devices. It comes after warnings the platform is harvesting vast amounts of
                            personal data from its users.The directive, issued via Parliamentary Service, cautioned
                            the app “could pose a security risk where data on your devices could be accessed by
                            ByteDance (the owner of TikTok) and the Chinese Government”. <a

                        <P>Instagram has begun massively changing the experience for its users, the kinds of content
                            they’re served and where that content can come from. In the coming months Meta’s other
                            advertising giant, Facebook, will do the same. It’s the biggest change to our biggest
                            social media platforms since they were founded, and it doesn’t feel like we’re talking
                            about it anywhere near enough. The Spinoff founder Duncan Greive and The Bulletin editor
                            (and veteran of brand social media) Anna Rawhiti-Connell exchanged a series of freaked
                            out emails to try and make sense of a world-changing event that we’re sleep-walking

                        <P>A year ago, Andrew Jeffcoat was “on the brink of depression”. The backstroker had missed
                            out on selection for the New Zealand team to contest the Tokyo Olympics and was
                            pondering his swimming future. On Tuesday morning (NZ time), Jeffcoat had a gold medal
                            draped around his neck after his victory in the men’s 50m backstroke final at the
                            Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. “My career's been full of ups and downs,” Jeffcoat
                            said soon after defeating South Africa’s Pieter Coetze by 0.12 seconds in a personal
                            best and NZ record time of 24.65.<a

                        <P>Andrew McFadden is coming back to the Warriors as the club’s general manager of
                            recruitment, development and pathways. McFadden, who was head coach of the Warriors
                            between 2014 and 2016, before becoming an assistant to Stephen Kearney, has agreed to
                            move back to New Zealand, replacing Craig Hodges. Hodges moved into recruitment position
                            at the end of last year, when Peter O’Sullivan left the club to move to the Dolphins.
                            However, Hodges wants to return to a coaching role in Australia, rather than have a
                            managerial position. <a

                        <P>The first aircraft for Australia's new domestic airline, Bonza, has arrived at its new
                            home on the Sunshine Coast. The Boeing 737 MAX, designated flight AB001, took off from
                            Boeing's facility in Seattle on Friday, making stops in Hawaii and Fiji for refuelling
                            before landing at the Sunshine Coast. Bonza is hoping to launch flights from September,
                            pending regulatory approval, and plans to initially fly to 17 destinations on 27 routes.
                            Twenty five of these routes are not currently serviced by other airlines, according to
                            Bonza. It is the first new airline to launch in Australia since the now-defunct Tigerair
                            in 2007, which shut down due to the pandemic. <a

                        <P>It is one of the most familiar elements of travelling on a plane: the announcement asking
                            for parents with young children to board first. But a mother and television host has
                            taken to social media with advice on how to make it less stressful for the kids. She
                            recommends turning the process on its head by boarding them last. Samantha Brown, who
                            hosts the show Samantha Brown’s Places To Love on PBS, a United States free-to-air
                            network, took to Instagram with the “marriage saving” tip. Brown's process needs two
                            parents as it involves a couple of steps: “Partner number one uses the pre-board to load
                            all the stuff onto the plane – the bags, the strollers etc,” she said.. <a

                        <P>The UK charities watchdog was accused of giving the Prince of Wales's charity
                            preferential treatment on Sunday and urged to investigate donations from the family of
                            Osama Bin Laden. The Sunday Times reported that the Prince of Wales Charitable Fund
                            (PWCF), founded by Charles to give grants to environmental and educational causes, had
                            accepted £1 million (NZ$1.93m) from the terrorist's half-brothers. Charles accepted the
                            money despite initial objections from advisers at Clarence House and at the fund.
                            Charity trustees have a legal and fiduciary obligation to maintain a charity's
                            independence and safeguard its reputation. They are also required to conduct due
                            diligence on donations.The UK Charity Commission would not comment on Sunday whether it
                            would take formal action. The UK regulator had decided not to investigate the charity
                            after it was reported that Charles had personally received three separate bundles of
                            cash, totalling €3m (NZ$4.87m), for the charity from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber
                            Al Thani, a former prime minister of Qatar. <a

                            previous three months’ average of 694. It was the lowest number of sales the agency had
